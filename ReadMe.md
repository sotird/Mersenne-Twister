# Mersenne Twister

This is a 64-Bit portable random number generator class based on the Mersenne Twister Algorithm that I am using for a couple of in-progress side projects.

This class, specifically, is an exploration of the 32-Bit Mersenne Twister algorithm developed in 1997 by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.
